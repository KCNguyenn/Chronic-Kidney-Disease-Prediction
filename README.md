# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course *"STAT630 Multivariate Analysis"* at Drexel, my team worked on an assigned dataset, using logistic regression to build a model and a screening tool to predict CKD presence. 

I don't own the dataset, so I don't have it uploaded here. Instead, I just uploaded the data description file.

### Tool(s): 
R

### Technique(s):
